# Zip-Gun-Bop

## Plot
  You're ```[Insert Main Character Name]```, the bell just rang and you're free to go home from school.
  However, for some reason you can't explain, everyone seems to have a piece of you, and wont stop until you
  fall for them.
  You're already engaged to someone, and she'll probably leave you if you get caught by any of them.

  Now you have to use all of you weirdness and bravado to creep girls out, and flip off guys! (also some traps that are mixed in.)

## Controls

* ```SPACE``` is used to start the game
* ```P``` is used to return to the title
* ```RMB``` is used to click on guys (and traps!)
* ```LMB``` is used to click on girls
* (also try out the ```middle mouse button``` when you win!)

## Victory conditions

You have to make through 60 people (by default) to get home safely, there's someone waiting for you!


# Customizing

You can modify the script to increase or decrease the amount of people you must pass by to get home.
